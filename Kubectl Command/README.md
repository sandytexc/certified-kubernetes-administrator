- Delete a K8s resource from a config file - `k delete -f config.yaml`

# Logs

- View logs of a pod - `k logs <pod-name>`
- View live logs of a pod - `k logs -f <pod-name>`
- View logs of a container in a multi-container pod (must specify the container name, otherwise the command will fail) - `k logs <pod-name> <container-name>`

- `k rollout undo deployment/<deployment-name> --to-revision=1` - rollback a deployment to a specific revision

# Node Commands

- Cordon a node (mark it unschedulable) - `k cordon <node-name>`
- Un-cordon a node (mark it schedulable) - `k uncordon <node-name>`
- Drain a node of all the pods - `k drain <node-name>`
- Drain a node of all the pods except DaemonSets - `k drain <node-name> --ignore-daemonsets`

# Auth

- View roles - `k get roles`
- View role bindings - `k get rolebindings`
- Check if you have access to perform an operation in K8s:
    - Create deployments - `k auth can-i create deployments`
    - Delete nodes in dev ns - `k auth can-i delete nodes -n dev`
- Check if another user has access to perform an operation in K8s:
    - Create deployments - `k auth can-i create deployments --as dev-user`
    - Delete nodes in dev namespace - `k auth can-i delete nodes --as dev-user -n dev`
- Check if a service account has access to perform an operation in K8s - `k auth can-i get pods --as=system:serviceaccount:default:<serviceaccount-name>`

# Config

- List all clusters - `k config get-clusters`
- Set context for a cluster - `k config use-context <cluster-name>`

## Certificates

- List all CSR - `k get csr`
- View a CSR in YAML format - `k get csr <csr-name> -o yaml`
- Delete a CSR - `k delete csr <csr-name>`
- Approve a CSR - `k certificate approve <csr-name>`
- Deny a CSR - `k certificate deny <csr-name>`

# Output formats

`-o json` - json output

`-o name` - only the resource name

`-o wide` - extra info in plain text

`-o yaml` - yaml output

# Useful Imperative Commands

- Create a pod - `k run <pod-name> --image=<image-name> --command -- <command-with-args>`
- Create a deployment - `k create deployment <deployment-name> --image <image-name> --replicas 3`
- Create a service for a deployment - `k expose deployment <deployment-name> --port 80 --name <service-name>`
- Create a service for a pod - `k expose pod <pod-name> --port 80 --name <service-name>`
- Edit a deployment (in memory) - `k edit deployment <deployment-name>`
- Scale a deployment - `k scale deployment <deployment-name> --replicas 3`
- Update the image in a deployment - `k set image deployment <deployment-name> <old-image>=<new-image>`
- Create resources from a config file - `k create -f filename.yaml`
- Update resources from a config file - `k replace -f filename.yaml`
- Delete and recreate resources from a config file - `k replace --force -f filename.yaml`
- Edit a deployment (doesnâ€™t work for pods as they require recreation) - `k edit deployment <deployment-name>`

# Handy Commands

- Get the config YAML of a pod - 
`k get pod <pod-name> -o yaml > pod.yaml`
- Get the config YAML of a deployment - 
`k get deployment <deployment-name> -o yaml > deployment.yaml`
- Create a sample config YAML file for a pod - `k run <pod-name> --image <image-name> --dry-run=client -o yaml > filename.yaml`
- Create a sample config YAML file for a deployment - `k create deployment <deployment-name> --image <image-name> --dry-run=client -o yaml > filename.yaml`
- Create a sample config YAML file for a service - `k expose deployment <deployment-name> --port 80 --dry-run=client -o yaml > filename.yaml`

## JSON Path in Kubectl

- Get images of all the pods - `k get pods -o jsonpath='{.items[0].spec.containers[0].image}'`

## Metrics

- Get top nodes by memory - `k top nodes --sort-by memory`
